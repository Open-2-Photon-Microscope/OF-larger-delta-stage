# Open Flexure delta stage as a system to move samples in 2P microscope

For this project we are leveraging the Open Flexure delta stage, and adapting it so that we can move samples under 2-photon microscopes. 

- We are testing the stage for stability after making it wider, so that we can have a thorlabs cage fitting below the moving part of the stage.
- In this way, the sample will be moving, but the cage system will be stationary below the moving sample. In the cage system, we will add light collection optiocs.
