##Part 3: Using the Device

'user()' allows manual inputs from the Thonny terminal in the form of a string.
For example: 
'y10' moves the sample 10 steps in the positive Y direction.
'a50' moves Motor A 50 steps.
'x-10' moves 10 steps in negative X direction.

NB as of writing (26/04/2024) each step in x or y corresponds to 12 times as many
i.e. x1 = 12 steps in x = 12* 0.5um = 6um
NBB each step in z counts as 3 steps (i.e. 1.5um)
