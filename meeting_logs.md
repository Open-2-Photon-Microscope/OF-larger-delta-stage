Andre and Filip:

Next steps:
- setup full Open Flexure Software environment
 - Sangaboard + RPi
- Check how well it plays with [ScanImage](https://docs.scanimage.org/)
- Figure out a way to control it manually (manipulator or joystick)
- Eventually check if this also works with other software

- research open source manipulators/joysticks to control the substage system
 - if there is nothing available create something.

- find an analogue voltmeter (possible good candidate https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/multimeters/8105526)

Outcomes from previous work package:
- Open flexure positioning is stable for our application.
- We used Serial commands over the Arduino IDE to quickly check things.
